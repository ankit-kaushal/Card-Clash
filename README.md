# Card Clash

**Card Clash** is a multiplayer card game where players can log in, make friends by adding them through usernames, and create thrilling card-based battles. Players can select cards and invite friends to play, with the game starting only after both players confirm their participation. Once all friends are in the game, any player can initiate the game and dive into a competitive experience.

## Project Vision

The goal of **Card Clash** is to provide a fun and engaging game where the excitement of card collection and strategic gameplay meet social interaction. Players can make new friends, challenge them to card duels, and enjoy an ever-evolving competitive environment.

I am currently building this game using **Next.js** to provide a seamless, fast, and scalable experience. The game will include features such as:

- **User authentication** for secure login.
- **Friendship system** to add and interact with friends.
- **Card selection and deck-building** to create personalized decks for each player.
- **Game invitations** that allow players to challenge friends.
- **Real-time multiplayer** using WebSockets (via Socket.io) to keep the game synchronized between players.
- **Game state persistence** to ensure that progress is saved.

Feel free to contribute, provide suggestions, or report any issues you may encounter. I’m open to new ideas and improvements as I continue building **Card Clash**.
